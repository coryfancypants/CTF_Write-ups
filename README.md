# CTF_Write-ups
A location to store my thoughts and notes, and how I solved various CTF's I participate in.

Hi, I am Cory Guzman, I am interested in Cyber Security, Malware Analysis, programming, One Piece, Cats, Video Games, art, DnD.
I started this repository to store and publicize documentation on Cyber Security related Capture The Flag Events, or VM's 
I will be posting write-ups from events, VulnHub VM's TryHackMe and HackTheBox, and various other works. 
I have been a system's administrator for the last 6 years of my life, and I am working on getting into Cyber Security as the next step I wanted to take. It's been a fun adventure to learn. 
If you do read my write-ups thank you for doing so, and if you have any recomendations on how I could improve, either technically, or how I structure the write-ups, I would love to hear about it, I am always learning.

To Start this off I participated in the Huntress CTF that happened in October of 2024.
