This year's Huntress CTF was hard, there were a lot of Reverse Engineering tasks that were way beyond me, that is what I need to work on for next year.
Overall, I thought I did really good! I am proud of what I placed, it was within the goal I set for myself. I wish I had thought to work on my write-ups sooner or even better while I am in the progress of working the challenge haha, live and learn.
